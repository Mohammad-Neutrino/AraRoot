Introduction
Here is some Doxygen generated documentation for the ARA ROOT based Test Bed software which is baed on the ANITA software.
Prerequisites

   1. ROOT
   2. FFTW 3 -- Fastest Fourier Transform in the West
   3. libRootFftwWrapper -- a ROOT wrapper for FFTW 3

Components

   1. ARA Event Library, ROOT classes for storing ARA data in ROOT files
   2. ARA Display, the display program based on the Marvellous ANITA Graphical Interface and Classy Display (Magic Display).
   3. ARA Web Plotter, the library and code which produces the dynamically updating webpages
   4. Utilities, programs for converting raw ARA data into ROOT-ified versions

Installation

   1. Ensure all the prerequisites are installed and in LD_LIBRARY_PATH or system paths.
   2. Set the environmental variable ARA_UTIL_INSTALL_DIR to point to the location you want the software installed in (note that lib, bin, etc. sub directories will be made)
   3. Do

      make

      make install

Making ROOT files
The makeAraEventTree executable is usedto convert raw ARA Test Bed / Station1 data into a ROOT format. The easiest way to do this is through the runAraTestBedEventFileMaker.sh or runAraOneEventFileMaker.sh script. The usage is

runAraEventFileMaker.sh (input dir) (outputfile)

where input dir is a directory that contains the ev_XXXXXXXX sub directories.
Running AraDisplay
The easiest way to get AraDisplay running is to use the runAraDisplay.C macro (it is in AraDisplay/macros). You can either edit the macro to point to a ROOT event file (created as above) or you can pass the ROOT file name from the command line as in

root 'macros/runAraDisplay.C("/Users/rjn/ara/data/root/event_200MHz_DISC01.root")
