use the following commands:


sqlite3 dbname.db < makeAntInfoATRI.sql


This is a friendly reminder that when you generate AntennaInfo.sqlite, please load both ATRI and ICRR antenans into it.

That is, you should do both command right after eachother (the file will not overwrite):

sqlite3 AntennaInfo.sqlite < makeAntInfoATRI.sql
sqlite3 AntennaInfo.sqlite < makeAntInfoICRR.sql
