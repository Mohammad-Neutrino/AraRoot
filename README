Introduction
============
This is the first version of the ARA ROOT-based TestBed software. The software comprises several libraries and executables.

Libraries:
----------
libAraEvent.so  -- Contains all of the class definitions for storing and manipulating Ara Event and Housekeeping data
libAraDisplay.so -- The library for AraDisplay (the MagicDisplay spin off)
libAraWebPlotter.so -- The library for the AraWebPlotter

Executables:
------------
makeAraEventTree -- Program to convert the raw ARA TestBed / Station One data into a ROOT format
AraWebRootFileMaker -- Program to make ROOT files for the webplotter
AraWebPlotter -- Program that reads these files and plots stuff

Scripts:
---------
runAraTestBedEventFileMaker.sh -- Script for calling makeAraEventTree to create TestBed root files
runAraOneEventFileMaker.sh -- Script for calling makeAraEventTree to create Station One root files

ROOT Macros:
------------
runAraDisplay.C -- Script for starting AraDisplay


Prerequisites
=============
ROOT

Optional Extras
================
(Necessary for FFT related fun, which is quite useful)
FFTW3 -- Fastest Fourier Transform in the West
libRootFftwWrapper -- a ROOT wrapper for FFTW 3 downloadable from
http://www.hep.ucl.ac.uk/uhen/libRootFftwWrapper/


Installation
============
Checkout the code from the ARA SVN repository, eg.: 
svn co svn+ssh://ara@hepts2.phys.hawaii.edu/data2/svnroot/ara/AraRoot AraRoot
or download the latest tarball from the website at the top of the file

Define the ARA_UTIL_INSTALL_DIR to point to the location you want the library installed (the library files will end up in (ARA_UTIL_INSTALL_DIR)/lib and the header files in (ARA_UTIL_INSTALL_DIR)/include and the executables in (ARA_UTIL_INSTALL_DIR)/bin). If this is not defined the installation directory will default to /usr/local
Do
make
make install


Troubleshooting
================
There are a myriad of ways that one can run into problems with the software
Path problems -- the bane of poorly organised code. By far the easiest way to use the ARA root code is to just set the ARA_UTIL_INSTALL_DIR and have it point to the location you want to install all the packages. If things are set up correctly you will end up with a ARA_UTIL_INSTALL_DIR/include and ARA_UTIL_INSTALL_DIR/lib and ARA_UTIL_INSTALL_DIR/share/anitaCalib all populated with essential headers, libraries and calibration constants. A quick round of
make clean all install
in libRootFftwWrapper and AraRoot can solve most such difficulties.
