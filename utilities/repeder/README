repeder: A tool to regenerate pedestals from event samples. 
Cosmin Deaconu <cozzyd@kicp.uchicago.edu> 

Usage: repeder input_file.root output_pedestal_file.dat 
        [-d] [-h] [-o output_file.root] [-x hist_channel_mask=0xf0f0f0f0] 
        [-m min_hist_adu=1238] [-M max_hist_adu=2262 ] [-b hist_adu_bin=1]

-h :  Display this message
-d :  Use median instead of mean (for channels defined in hist mask only)
-o :  Auxilliary ROOT output. Will contain histograms for channels in hist mask and also mean/rms graphs. 
-x :  Histogram mask. Has no effect if neither -o nor -d are defined. 
-C :  Include events marked as calpulsers. Default is to exclude. 
-m,-M,-b :   Set histogram bounds /binning.  

This tool should be run on 100% data input for best results. By default, will just use the
mean of each sample over the run for the pedestals.  With the -d option, the
median will be used but only for channels defined in the mask (-x). 

Calculating the median requires histogramming so will use some amount of memory
(32768 * 2 bytes * channels in mask * bins in histogram). The histogram binning
can be controlled by -m/-M/-b. 

An output file can be specified with -o that will store any histograms in the
mask as well as TGraphErrors containing the mean/RMS of each sample. Enabling
ROOT output enables the histograms in the mask even if the median option is not
specified.
